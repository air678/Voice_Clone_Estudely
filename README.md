This repo is created to showcase my work that i did for estudely contest.

the .wav file that i mentioned in the code with the name of advent of code is the audio file which i converted from one of the youtube live stream video.
I know it doesn't feel like i cloned the voice rather than it feels like i am just converting the text to speech, all the things which i did was asked with ai but my exam was going so couldn't work on it to improve it by my own or even with ai but i'll definitely gonna try to improve or make a new model after my exams.

and i am really excited to test and see how other made their project :)
